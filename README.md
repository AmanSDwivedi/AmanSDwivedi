# Aman Dwivedi  
Junior Data Scientist | Machine Learning | Applied AI  

I build data-driven systems that solve real-world problems using machine learning and statistical analysis.  
Strong focus on end-to-end projects: data collection → modeling → evaluation → deployment.

## Core Skills
- Programming: Python, SQL  
- Data: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- ML/DL: CNNs, NLP, TensorFlow, Keras  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI  
- Tools: Git, Docker, Jupyter  

## Featured Projects
